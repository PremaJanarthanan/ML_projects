### Know-Your-Dataset
*Attributes are numeric so you have to figure out how to load and handle data
*It is a classification problem, allowing you to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm
*It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling
*It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory
*All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started

### Installing-The-Python-and-SciPy-Platform
There are 5 key libraries that you will need to install. </br>
*scipy
*numpy
*matplotlib
*pandas
*sklearn
### Loading-the-dataset
*This dataset is famous because it is used as the “hello world” dataset in machine learning and statistics by pretty much everyone
*The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters
*The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. All observed flowers belong to one of three species
### Summarizing-the-dataset
In this step we are going to take a look at the data a few different ways</br>

*Dimensions of the dataset
*Peek at the data itself
*Statistical summary of all attributes
*Breakdown of the data by the class variable
### Visualizing-the-dataset
We are going to look at two types of plots:</br>

*Univariate plots to better understand each attribute
*Multivariate plots to better understand the relationships between attributes
### Evaluating-some-algorithms
Here is what we are going to cover in this step:

-Separate out a validation dataset
-Set-up the test harness to use 10-fold cross validation
-Build multiple different models to predict species from flower measurements
-Select the best model
### Making-some-predictions
-Make Predictions
-Evaluate predictions
